# Summary

ProcMem is a simple C++ library designed for interaction with the memory space 
of a target process. There are templates and functions for doing things such
as reading and writing to an external or internal (via dll injection) process.
I got tired of defining the class in all of my projects, so I compiled it into
this library to make it easier on myself.
